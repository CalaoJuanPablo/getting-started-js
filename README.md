### Programming Primer

This is an exercise to practice basic programming principles.

1. Define an `addFavoriteBook(..)` function that receives a single parameter, called `bookName`.
2. If the provided `bookName` string does **NOT** have the word "Great" in it, add it to the `favoriteBooks` array.
3. Define a `printFavoriteBooks()` function that receive no paraeters.
4. `printFavoriteBooks()` should first print a message like "Favorite Books: ...", and include the number of books in the `favoriteBooks` array.
5. Finally, `printFavoriteBooks()` should loop though the `favoriteBooks` array and print each value.
